                <h2>Figure Skating is a Sport that Combines Artistry and Athleticism</h2>
                <p>Figure skating consists of four disciplines: men's, women's, ice dance, and pairs.
                <br> The men's and women's disciplines are individual while ice dance and pairs consist of a team of one man and one woman.
                In all the disciplines, skaters are graded on two categories; technical and component. Technical scores have to do with elements such as jumps
                and spins (for men's and women's), lifts (in ice dance), and throws (in pairs), among other things. Component scores have to do with 
                presentation and artistry.  </p>
                <h2>Jumps</h2>
                <p>Jumps are present in all disciplines of figure skating except ice dance. Jumps are probably what
                    most people outside of the skating community remember best when events like the Olympics happen. 
                    <br>In figure skating, there are six types of jumps: toe loop, flip, lutz, salchow, loop, and axel.
                    What differentiates each jumps is the take off. Some jumps are toe jumps (toe loop, flip, and lutz).
                    This means that a skater uses the toe pick at the front of their skate to help them launch themselves into the air. 
                    The other jumps are edge jumps (salchow, loop, and axel). This means that the skater doesn't use their 
                    toe pick to get into the air and just relies on the edge of their blade. 
                    <br>What differentiates the jumps within each category is what part of the blade a skater takes off from.
                    For example, a toe loop jump takes off from the back outside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the same foot.
                    But, for another toe jump such as the flip takes off from the back inside edge and lands on the opposite foot. 
                    <br>Also, quick fun fact: the axel is the only jump that takes off while the skater is going forward! All the other jumps
                    take off while the skater is going backward. 
                </p>
                <h2>Ice Dance</h2>
                <p>Ice dance doesn't really share any technical elements with the other disciplines.
                   They don't have the technical elements of jumps and spins. Instead, they are mainly scored based on 
                   lifts that they perform and how in sync they are. 
                   Also, in the other disciplines, while artistry is still very important, it tends to get swallowed up by 
                   elements such as jumps and spins. But, in ice dance, artistry is just as important as the technical elements
                   and doesn't tend to get swallowed up. With ice dance, it's all about the performance and story. 
                </p>
                <h2>Pairs</h2>
                <p>Pairs is the discipline that is probably the most anxiety inducing out of all of the disciplines (in my humble opinion).
                    I say this because of the crazy tricks that the skaters do. Earlier, I mentioned throws. Maybe you don't know exactly
                    what I mean, so I'll fill you in. Throws are where the male skater will launch the female skater across the ice. The female skater 
                    will rotate in the air like a she just performed a normal jump, and then will have to land just like a normal jump. It's so 
                    crazy. Also, pairs will have to do side by side jumps and spins. And they have to be in sync!! It's insane, honestly. 
                    <br>When you think about it, pairs has a ton of technical elements. Other technical elements include tosses (where a male skater
                    will toss his partner in the air, have her rotate in the air, and then catch her all while moving) and lifts. 
                    While both pairs and ice dance have lifts, they are slightly different. 
                    <br>In ice dance, the male skater will never extend his
                    arms to lift his partner in the air. Most of the time, the female skater will be on the male skater's shoulders. 
                    But in pairs, the male skater will extend his arm and basically hold his partner up with one hand in the air 
                    while twirling around on the ice. I hope you're getting why I say this is the most anxiety inducing discipline. 
                    Okay, one last element to talk about for pairs that seriously makes it an insane sport.
