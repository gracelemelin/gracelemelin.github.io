                <h1>Figure Skating is a Sport that Combines Artistry and Athleticism</h1>
                <p>Figure skating consists of four disciplines: men's, women's, ice dance, and pairs.
                <br> The men's and women's disciplines are individual while ice dance and pairs consist of a team of one man and one woman.
                In all the disciplines, skaters are graded on two categories; technical and component. Technical scores have to do with elements such as jumps
                and spins (for men's and women's), lifts (in ice dance), and throws (in pairs), among other things. Component scores have to do with 
                presentation and artistry.  </p>
                <h2>Jumps</h2>
                <p>Jumps are present in all disciplines of figure skating except ice dance. Jumps are probably what
                    most people outside of the skating community remember best when events like the Olympics happen. 
                    <br>In figure skating, there are six types of jumps: toe loop, flip, lutz, salchow, loop, and axel.
                    What differentiates each jumps is the take off. Some jumps are toe jumps (toe loop, flip, and lutz).
                    This means that a skater uses the toe pick at the front of their skate to help them launch themselves into the air. 
                    The other jumps are edge jumps (salchow, loop, and axel). This means that the skater doesn't use their 
                    toe pick to get into the air and just relies on the edge of their blade. 
                    <br>What differentiates the jumps within each category is what part of the blade a skater takes off from.
                    For example, a toe loop jump takes off from the back outside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the same foot.
                    But, for another toe jump such as the flip takes off from the back inside edge and lands on the opposite foot. 
                    <br>Also, quick fun fact: the axel is the only jump that takes off while the skater is going forward! All the other jumps
                    take off while the skater is going forward.
