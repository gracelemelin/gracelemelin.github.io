                    This is Mariah Bell. She was a competitive figure skater that represented the US. She retired from competitive figure skating in October 2022.
                    The performance I'm recommending is her free skate from the 2020 US Figure Skating Championships to the song Hallelujah by k.d. Lang. Mariah was
                    an American skater that placed in third in previous years at this same competition. In 2020, she had a major opportunity in her free skate because
                    another skater, Bradie Tennell, wavered in her free skate (which was right before Mariah's performance). A door opened to the silver medal for Mariah. 
                    There was quite a lot of pressure on Mariah, and she hasn't always been known for her consistent performances. However, she had been becoming more consistent over the 
                    period of the 2020 figure skating season, and had laid down multiple clean skates (skates where she didn't make any mistakes such as falls on jumps). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that Mariah's skating is always enjoyable because she has a beautiful quality of skating. Whenever she does anything, she has amazing posture, and it 
                    seems like she always knows where to perfectly place her arms and legs. This makes her spins so mesmerizing in particular. In this particular performance, 
                    she doesn't rush through choreography and makes transitions between jumps so beautiful because she incorporates choreographic sequences everywhere. 
                    I remember the first time I watched this performance, I got goosebumps and teared up a little bit. Mariah realized she had an amazing free skate
                    and that she landed all of her jumps, so in the last minute, she just had this huge smile across her face, and it was so contagious.
                    Everything just went so right in this performance. The music was beautiful, her dress was beautiful, her skating was beautiful. It was so amazing.

                    Jason Brown is also an American figure skater, and is one of my favorites. I actually got to see him skate live in April 2022! He's an amazing performer and is a 
                    clear crowd favorite. The reason he's such a crowd favorite is because he's known for his artistry. He's probably one of the most artistic skaters of all time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This performance is from the 2022 Beijing Olympics, which was a big deal for Jason. He actually competed at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, but wasn't chosen 
                    for the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. It's amazing he was selected for the 2022 Olympics because he was 27 at the time, which is considered old. This 
                    means that from 2014 to 2022, he's remained competitive despite the newer, younger skaters coming into the sport. 
                    He never gave up on his dream of returning to the Olympics, and it paid off.  
                </p>

                    This his short program called Sinnerman (since it's to the song Sinnerman by Nina Simone). Honestly, this is one of my favorite performances of all time.
                    Jason will capture you with his performance. He's fully invested in not only using his face, but also his body to perform to the fullest. To me, he's a 
                    performer before a skater just because his performance covers up all the elements of his skate. For example, he transitions so smoothly into and out of 
                    a jump, so it feels like the jump was a part of the performance. Jason is also a very consistent skater, which is one reason why he was selected to go 
                    to the 2022 Olympics. He's a reliable skater, so you don't feel any worries when he goes into a jump. You know that he's going to land it, so you can 
                    focus on his dancing.
