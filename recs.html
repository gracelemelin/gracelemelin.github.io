                    This is Mariah Bell. She was a competitive figure skater that represented the US. She retired from competitive figure skating in October 2022.
                    The performance I'm recommending is her free skate from the 2020 US Figure Skating Championships to the song Hallelujah by k.d. Lang. Mariah was
                    an American skater that placed in third in previous years at this same competition. In 2020, she had a major opportunity in her free skate because
                    another skater, Bradie Tennell, wavered in her free skate (which was right before Mariah's performance). A door opened to the silver medal for Mariah. 
                    There was quite a lot of pressure on Mariah, and she hasn't always been known for her consistent performances. However, she had been becoming more consistent over the 
                    period of the 2020 figure skating season, and had laid down multiple clean skates (skates where she didn't make any mistakes such as falls on jumps). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that Mariah's skating is always enjoyable because she has a beautiful quality of skating. Whenever she does anything, she has amazing posture, and it 
                    seems like she always knows where to perfectly place her arms and legs. This makes her spins so mesmerizing in particular. In this particular performance, 
                    she doesn't rush through choreography and makes transitions between jumps so beautiful because she incorporates choreographic sequences everywhere. 
                    I remember the first time I watched this performance, I got goosebumps and teared up a little bit. Mariah realized she had an amazing free skate
                    and that she landed all of her jumps, so in the last minute, she just had this huge smile across her face, and it was so contagious.
                    Everything just went so right in this performance. The music was beautiful, her dress was beautiful, her skating was beautiful. It was so amazing. 
                </p>
